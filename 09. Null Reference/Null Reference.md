(Verse 1)
I wake to static where the feeling was,
A body moving without cause.
The light pours in but doesn’t land,
I’m watching life from empty hands.

(Chorus)
I just wanna feel something,
Anything at all.
I just wanna feel something,
Before I disappear and fall.
Paint the edges red to prove I’m here,
Make it real, make it clear.

(Verse 2)
The world keeps turning, colors bright,
But I’m just tracing absent light.
My skin becomes the only page
Where truth can break through numbness’ cage.

(Chorus)
I just wanna feel something,
Anything at all.
I just wanna feel something,
Before I disappear and fall.
Paint the edges red to prove I’m here,
Make it real, make it clear.

(Bridge)
A null reference to who I was,
No value found, no path, no cause.
The blade becomes my compiler,
Blood the only thing that’s realer.

(Breakdown)
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

(Chorus)
I just wanna feel something,
Anything at all.
I just wanna feel something,
Before I fade beyond recall.
The blood reminds me I’m still here,
Proof through pain, strong and clear.

(Outro)
A null reference to the light…
I’m undefined tonight…
