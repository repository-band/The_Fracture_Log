(Verse 1)
I’m packing up the fragments,
Folding ghosts in cardboard frames.
The road ahead looks cleaner,
But the weight still feels the same.
They say the city swallows names,
No whispers, no old chains —
I walk through doors that lead nowhere
Convinced I’ll finally change.

(Pre-Chorus)
But every box I’m loading
Holds more than what I see.

(Chorus)
I’m trying to merge the versions,
Rewrite what could not compile.
Leave the hometown conflicts buried,
covered by dust and fading light.
But the code keeps throwing errors,
The past won’t reconcile.
I moved the body forward,
But the scars just walked beside.

(Verse 2)
The skyline feels like freedom,
The crowds like privacy.
No faces that remember
Every version I used to be.
The quiet cuts like feedback loops
Echoes louder than before —
I thought distance was the answer,
But I brought it through the door.

(Pre-Chorus)
All the things I left behind
Are unpacking next to me.

(Chorus)
I’m trying to merge the versions,
Rewrite what could not compile.
Leave the hometown conflicts buried,
covered by dust and fading light.
But the code keeps throwing errors,
The past won’t reconcile.
I moved the body forward,
But the scars just walked beside.

(Bridge)
You can’t outrun the architecture,
Can’t delete the broken lines.
Every push I make to somewhere new
Still pulls the old design.
The merge fails, the branches clash,
No resolution found —
I’m standing in a different place,
But rooted in the same ground.
“Merge conflict detected.
Cannot automatically resolve.
External intervention required.”

(Chorus)
I’m trying to merge the versions,
Integrate what won’t align.
Left the town but not the tension,
Crossed the border, kept the bind.
The code is still uncertain,
The wounds need redefined —
I’m learning that the journey
Isn’t leaving pain behind.

(Outro)
Maybe merging isn’t solving,
Maybe peace is in the pull.
The conflicts still unfolding,
and the memory corrupt.
I’ll commit this broken progress,
Push it forward, incomplete —
A human branch still learning
How to parse defeat.
