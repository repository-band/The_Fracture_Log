(Verse 1)
Locked inside these walls, away from endless noise,
Silent shadows keep me company, my only choice.
Alone but not empty, craving eyes I never find,
Level after level, forging strength within my mind.

(Pre-Chorus)
Whispers turn to thunder in this stillness I command,
A refuge and a battlefield where I take my stand.

(Chorus)
BREAK THE SILENCE!
SHOUT IT OUT!
BURN THE FEAR!
LET IT OUT!
RISE FROM ASHES!
SMASH THE DOOM!
This is our quiet room.

(Verse 2)
Echoes of chaos clash with the calm I hold inside,
Fury fuels these veins where that silent storm resides.
No peace without the struggle, no light without the fight,
In the quiet room, I rage against the dying night.

(Bridge)
LOUDER, STRONGER, NEVER FADE!
IN THE SHADOWS, I'M REMADE!

(Chorus)
BREAK THE SILENCE!
SHOUT IT OUT!
BURN THE FEAR!
LET IT OUT!
RISE FROM ASHES!
SMASH THE DOOM!
This is our quiet room.
BREAK THE SILENCE!
SHOUT IT OUT!
BURN THE FEAR!
LET IT OUT!
RISE FROM ASHES!
SMASH THE DOOM!
This is our quiet room.

(Bridge)
Our quiet room
Where we are all alone
Our quiet room
Our quiet room
This fucking quiet room
LET ME OUT!

(Outro)
Alone but alive, the quiet fuels the flame,
In silence and fury, I own my name.
