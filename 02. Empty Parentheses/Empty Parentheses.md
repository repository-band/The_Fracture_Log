(Verse 1)
In the hollow curve of silence where words never formed,
I trace the outline of absence, cold and undefined.
A space left waiting, unmapped in the code of my skin,
Echoes folded softly where love should have been.

(Pre-Chorus)
No error thrown, no warning sign,
Just a missing line in an empty design.

(Chorus)
These empty parentheses hold the weight of what’s not said,
A void between the fragments of the stories in my head.
They whisper quiet questions in the language of lost time,
Holding shadows in their shape, forever undefined.

(Verse 2)
The quiet room breathes secrets in a syntax never learned,
Fingers reach for phantom lines that vanish when they yearn.
No fill to close the brackets opened wide in youth’s refrain,
Patterns broken softly by the absence left to remain.

(Bridge)
Fill me, hold me, hear me…

(Chorus)
These empty parentheses hold the weight of what’s not said,
A void between the fragments of the stories in my head.
They whisper quiet questions in the language of lost time,
Holding shadows in their shape, forever undefined.

(Outro)
In every hollow silence where a secret once was carved,
I find the space to learn that absence is also a part.
