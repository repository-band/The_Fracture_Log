(Verse 1)
It comes uninvited, forcing its way in,
The walls I built collapse beneath its grin.
Every borrowed piece that never comes back,
Every word that pulls me off the track.
I wear the mask, stay quiet, stay small,
Hoping silence keeps me from the fall.

(Pre-Chorus)
The ground beneath me cracks and splits,
I’m holding on but losing grip.

(Chorus)
BREAKING DOWN!
CAN’T HOLD ON!
BREAKING DOWN!
IT WON’T STOP!
BREAKING DOWN!
LOSING GROUND!
THIS BRANCH IS BREAKING DOWN!

(Verse 2)
No one knows the visits, no one sees the theft,
Just the echo of my safety, nothing left.
Every step I take feels like I’m being watched,
Every boundary crossed, every trust destroyed and botched.

(Bridge)
I didn’t choose this,
I didn’t ask for fear,
But every time it’s gone,
I feel it still near.

(Breakdown)
I’m breaking, splitting, splintering apart,
The fractures run too deep to restart.

(Chorus)
BREAKING DOWN!
CAN’T HOLD ON!
BREAKING DOWN!
IT WON’T STOP!
BREAKING DOWN!
LOSING GROUND!
THIS BRANCH IS BREAKING DOWN!
IT WON’T STOP!
BREAKING DOWN!
LOSING GROUND!
THIS BRANCH IS BREAKING DOWN!
IT WON’T STOP!
IT WON’T STOP!
BREAKING DOWN!
LOSING GROUND!
THIS BRANCH IS BREAKING DOWN!

(Outro)
And no one ever knew.
