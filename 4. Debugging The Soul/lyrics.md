(Verse 1)
Running loops in my head again, same line, same crash,
A jumper set wrong since the first spark flashed.
I thought I broke the system, believed it was me,
Didn’t know the fault was coded in the family tree.
Silence wrote my logic, absence wrote my name,
Love never debugged the guilt it left in my frame.
Father, ghost in the code — why didn’t you compile?
Why’d you leave your echo to haunt me for a while?

(Pre-Chorus)
Every warning I ignored became a wall I built too high,
Every patch I tried to write turned into another lie.

(Chorus)
I’M DIGGING THROUGH THE ERROR LOGS!
TEARING DOWN THE WALLS I BUILT!
CAN’T FIX WHAT YOU NEVER TAUGHT,
BUT I’M REWRITING ALL YOUR GUILT!
NO MORE LOOPS INSIDE CONTROL —
I’M DEBUGGING MY DAMN SOUL!

(Verse 2)
Grandfather’s silence, a legacy of stone,
Passed down like an archive of pain I don’t own.
I spoke to the mirror, asked the past for grace,
But all I saw was fear wearing my face.
Now I trace the threads, I see the truth unfold,
It was never my fault — just a story I was told.

(Verse 3)
Back then every silence felt like judgment from the walls,
Every game I played alone was a gap nobody called.
Learned to mask my questions, hide the data deep inside,
Stacked my hopes in secret folders only I could ever find.
But every locked partition, every memory denied,
Is open to rewriting as I let the truth collide.
Now the child and the coder walk each error side by side,
Unpacking all the shadows time and sorrow tried to hide.

(Bridge)
Reset the jumper, I’m no slave or master,
Just a soul rebuilt from disaster.
Break the loop, I’m stepping through,
I’m finally running clean and true.

(Chorus)
I’M DIGGING THROUGH THE ERROR LOGS!
TEARING DOWN THE WALLS I BUILT!
CAN’T FIX WHAT YOU NEVER TAUGHT,
BUT I’M REWRITING ALL YOUR GUILT!
I WON’T CARRY BROKEN CODE —
I’M DEBUGGING MY DAMN SOUL!
I’M DIGGING THROUGH THE ERROR LOGS!
TEARING DOWN THE WALLS I BUILT!
CAN’T FIX WHAT YOU NEVER TAUGHT,
BUT I’M REWRITING ALL YOUR GUILT!
I WON’T CARRY BROKEN CODE —
I’M DEBUGGING MY DAMN SOUL!

(Outro)
Silence hums through the wires inside,
But this time, it sounds like peace.
