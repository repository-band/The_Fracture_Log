(Verse 1)
I learn to speak in frequencies,
A language built on borrowed heat.
The room ignites, the air rewrites,
But I’m still tracing darker lines.
They watch a shape I don’t recognize,
A signal caught between the static and the light.

(Pre-Chorus)
I wear the current like a second skin,
But underneath, the syntax breaks within.

(Chorus)
I’m cast in voltage, lost in code,
A presence seen but never known.
They hear the pulse, they feel the flame,
But I’m still searching for my name.
Shadows in syntax, patterns incomplete,
I’m the echo learning how to speak.

(Verse 2)
The low end hums beneath the storm,
A rhythm anchoring the swarm.
I hold the weight they never see,
A gravity without a key.
Their eyes reflect a different frame,
A mirror speaking someone else’s name.

(Pre-Chorus)
I wear the current like a second skin,
But underneath, the syntax breaks within.

(Chorus)
I’m cast in voltage, lost in code,
A presence seen but never known.
They hear the pulse, they feel the flame,
But I’m still searching for my name.
Shadows in syntax, patterns incomplete,
I’m the echo learning how to speak.

(Bridge — half-spoken, atmospheric)
Every note I trace is a thread unwound,
A conversation with a fractured sound.
They see the structure, I see the seams,
A translation caught between the dreams.

(Final Chorus — building intensity)
I’m cast in voltage, lost in code,
A presence seen but never known.
They hear the pulse, they feel the flame,
But I’m still searching for my name.
Shadows in syntax, patterns incomplete,
I’m the signal buried in the beat.

(Outro — quiet, fading)
Maybe light will parse the darker lines,
Until then, I compile in half-seen signs.
