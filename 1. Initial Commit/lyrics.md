(Verse 1)
Beneath the static hum of night, I search for traces lost in code,
Fragments of a self I never fully knew, buried deep in silent lines.
I’m here to map the shadows, rewrite the fractured script,
To find the space where broken pieces begin to breathe again.

(Pre-Chorus)
There is a weight that folds me inward,
An ache encoded in memories I never chose to keep,
But now I reach through the noise,
To unbind the loops that hold me captive.

(Chorus)
This is my initial commit,
The first step toward light in a system built on absence.
I push into the void, line by fragile line,
To claim a voice within the silent logs of what’s been left behind.

(Verse 2)
Empty parentheses hold the spaces where love was meant to live,
I trace their hollow curves, searching for rhythm in the emptiness.
This is not just code, it is a call to something larger,
A hope that in rewriting, I might finally begin to heal.

(Bridge)
With each merge, a crack opens wider,
Exposing truth beneath the fragile syntax of my past.
I offer this log as proof: I am here, I am breaking, I am becoming.

(Chorus)
This is my initial commit,
The first step toward light in a system built on absence.
I push into the void, line by fragile line,
To claim a voice within the silent logs of what’s been left behind.

(Outro)
In this repository of loss, I write myself anew,
A code not perfect, but mine to claim.
