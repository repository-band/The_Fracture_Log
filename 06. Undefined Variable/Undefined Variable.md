(Verse 1)
I don’t know what I am to you,
A question left unanswered in the room.
I wait for something I can’t name,
A variable undefined, a value never claimed.

(Pre-Chorus)
Do you see me standing here?
Do you feel what I feel?

(Chorus)
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?

(Verse 2)
I trace the shape of words unsaid,
A phantom loop inside my head.
I’m caught between what is and what could be,
An empty placeholder where you’ll never see me.

(Pre-Chorus)
Do you see me standing here?
Do you feel what I feel?

(Chorus)
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?

(Bridge)
I’m undefined,
Waiting for a value you.. you never assign.
I’m undefined,
A broken reference, lost in time.

(Final Chorus)
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?
Am I something to you?

(Outro)
Undefined… undefined…
