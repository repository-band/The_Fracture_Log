(Verse 1)
I walk beneath the sodium light,
Every shadow split in two.
The sidewalk cracks like old decisions,
Each one whispering what I never knew.
The air tastes of rain and static,
And somewhere, the future waits in blue.

(Pre-Chorus)
I trace two lines across the dark,
Both fading at the edge of sight —
One paved with silence, one with spark,
Both asking me to write.

(Chorus)
Two roads divide the heart I hold,
One pulls, the other lets me go.
Both carved from what I can’t control,
The past and what I hope to know.
Choice isn’t truth — it’s motion cast,
The signal buried in the static mass.

(Verse 2)
An engine hums beyond the fields,
The world keeps moving without ask.
I measure distance by forgiveness,
Each step a small unmask.
The wind rewrites my hesitation,
And I walk the line between what was and might last.

(Bridge)
I’m learning that direction isn’t fate,
Just the courage to misstep and stay awake.
Every road becomes itself in motion —
A mirror fractured, yet whole in devotion.

(Chorus)
Two roads divide the heart I hold,
One pulls, the other lets me go.
Both carved from what I can’t control,
The past and what I hope to know.
Choice isn’t truth — it’s motion cast,
The signal buried in the static mass.

(Outro)
When morning finds me, I won’t look back,
Each wrong turn becomes its map.
And if I vanish in the space between,
Let it be here — where choices dream.
